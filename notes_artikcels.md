## Appling tracking game system to measure user behavior toward cybersecurity policies

>__abstract__ Institutions wrestle to protect their information from threats and cybercrime.
Therefore, it is dedicating a great deal of their concern to improving the
information security infrastructure. Users’ behaviors were explored by
applying traditional questionnaire as a research instrument in data collocate
process. But researchers usually suffer from a lack of respondents' credibility
when asking someone to fill out a questionnaire, and the credibility may
decline further if the research topic relates to aspects of the use and
implementation of information security policies. Therefore, there is
insufficient reliability of the respondent's answers to the questionnaire’s
questions, and the responses might not reflect the actual behavior based on
the human bias when facing the problems theoretically. The current study
creates a new idea to track and study the behavior of the respondents by
building a tracking game system aligned with the questionnaire whose
results are required to be known. The system will allow the respondent to
answer the survey questions related to the compliance with the information
security policies by tracking their behavior while using the system



Den virker rimelig brugbar. der er noget snak om bias og indsamling af respondenter. 

## Design and Evaluation of an Augmented Reality Game for Cybersecurity Awareness (CybAR)

>**abstract**: Abstract: The number of damaging cyberattacks is increasing exponentially due in part to lack of
user awareness of risky online practices, such as visiting unsafe websites, ignoring warning messages,
and communicating with unauthenticated entities. Although research has established the role that
game-based learning can play in cognitive development and conceptual learning, relatively few
serious mobile games have been developed to educate users about different forms of cyberattack and
ways of avoiding them. This paper reports the development of an effective augmented reality (AR)
game designed to increase cybersecurity awareness and knowledge in an active and entertaining
way. The Cybersecurity Awareness using Augmented Reality (CybAR) game is an AR mobile
application that teaches not only cybersecurity concepts, but also demonstrates the consequences
of actual cybersecurity attacks through feedback. The design and evaluation of the application are
described in detail. A survey was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the game received positive
responses from 91 participants. The results indicate that CybAR is useful for players to develop an
understanding of cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities.

Det er et mobile game - så et faktisk spil, men det direkte takler awareness og har kvant data med 91 respondenter. jeg kan godt lide det. 

## Gamification of Cybersecurity for Workforce Development in Critical Infrastructure

>**abstract**: Critical infrastructure has become a focal point of cyberattacks, as previously isolated
operational technology networks that were once perceived to be air-gapped are becoming Internet-exposed
through increased connectivity with informational technology networks. Recent adversarial tendencies have
led to an increase in targeted cyberattacks against both industrial control systems (ICS) and building
automation systems. Furthermore, the insufﬁcient supply of a cyber workforce exacerbates the challenges
for organizations to defend their systems. Game-based learning is gaining traction and studies have shown
that it is an effective educational element. Training facility operators responsible for critical services can
be achieved through gamiﬁcation of security policies and controls. The Network Defense Training Game
(NDTG) is a cybersecurity training platform that encompasses a series of cybersecurity events that the player
must assess and react to throughout the scenario to defend the network by thwarting the adversary’s attack.
The NDTG uses scenario narratives based on historical cyber incidents that affect ICS. It is designed to train
facility owners and operators to evaluate their cybersecurity posture and to apply cybersecurity frameworks
before and during the process of addressing cyber events and incidents. This study provides a detailed
technical overview and design architecture of NDTG and demonstrates its capability in advancing the ICS
cybersecurity workforce

okay altså casen er virkelig fed... men det er *"detailed technical overview"*. Men tror stadig godt vi kan få noget ud af det. 

## Digital tools and challenges in human resourcedevelopment and its potential within the maritime sector through bibliometric analysis

>**abstract**: The maritime industry, a cornerstone of global trade and commerce, is currently undergoing a
significant transformation, primarily driven by technological advancements. Human resource
development (HRD) in maritime industry has become a focal point, aimed at improving opera-
tional efficiency, safety, and competitiveness. This research paper conducts an in-depth exam-
ination of digital tools and its challenges in the context of maritime HRD through bibliometric
analysis. The findings indicate the presence of a variety of digital technologies, such as e-learning
platforms (ELP), learning management systems (LMS), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),
gamification, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Nevertheless, the maritime
sector may encounter a range of obstacles including issues related to security concerns, skill
gaps, strategic planning, change management, budget constraints, and regulatory compliance.
To effectively address these difficulties, it is essential to adopt a comprehensive strategy that
includes many components such as cybersecurity measures, efforts for talent development,
strategic alignment, change management techniques, budgetary restraint, and legal scrutiny.
The findings of this study have significant consequences for the maritime sector, governments,
and the academic community. It is recommended that maritime sector can use digitization as a
fundamental component of their competitiveness and safety measures.

Først tænke jeg den var helt ubrugelig den her, men viser sig den undersøger vores problem stilling i henhold til den maritime sector. Kan måske være fedt til at understrege visse pointer?

## Cybercompetitions: A survey of competitions, tools, and systems to support cybersecurity education

>**abstract**: Over the last decade, industry and academia have worked towards raising stu-
dents’ interests in cybersecurity through game-like competitions to fill a shortfall
of cybersecurity professionals. Rising interest in video games in combination with
gamification techniques make learning fun, easy, and addictive. It is crucial that
cybersecurity curricula enhance and expose cybersecurity education to a diversified
student body to meet workforce demands. Gamification through cybercompetitions
is one method to achieve that. With a vast list of options for competition type,
focus areas, learning outcomes, and participant experience levels we need to system-
atize knowledge of attributes that ameliorate cybercompetitions. In the wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic and global lock-downs, competition hosts scrambled to move
platforms from local to online infrastructure due to poor interoperability between
competition software. We derive a list of takeaways including the lack of interop-
erability between state-of-the-art competition systems, breaking the high knowledge
barrier to participate, addressing competition type diversity, then suggest potential
solutions and research questions moving forward. Our paper aims to systematize
cybersecurity, access control, and programming competitions by surveying the his-
tory of these events. We explore the types of competitions that have been hosted
and categorize them based on focus areas related to the InfoSEC Color Wheel. We
then explore state-of-the-art technologies that enable these types of competitions, and
finally, present our takeaways.

**well this is just fuckign delisous.** Virker til at være en oversigt over alle værktøjer der bruges til at understøtte cybersecurity træning. 

## Cybersecurity Knowledge Deterioration and the role of Gamification Intervention
>**abtract**: Cybersecurity is becoming an overly critical issue in contemporary times. Cyberspace
safety is declining, covering all sphere of humanity. Deterioration in cybersecurity
knowledge and awareness has resulted to more cybercrime victimisation. The more
novel security systems are being developed, the higher the innovativeness of
cybercriminals techniques to attack cyber-users. Thus, investigating the stance of
cybersecurity knowledge among general IT (Information Technology) users, especially
in the 21st century is paramount. This paper designed a cybersecurity quiz based on
adaptations from literature and past cybersecurity quizzes and conducted
investigations to test the knowledge of random cyber-users. Results from investigations
are instructive, thus serving as a propelling motivation to develop a cybersecurity game.
Findings reveal that most cyber-users lack knowledge about network security. Also,
respondents lacked knowledge on social engineering. Thus, it is important for upcoming
innovations to consider aspects of network security, social engineering when designing
cybersecurity gamification approaches. Gamification has been used as teaching aids for
diverse learning fields, however its application in cybersecurity is still understudied. The
result of this quiz is intended to further boost the development of a cybersecurity game,
which can be age centric, thus developing suitable cybersecurity games for specific user
groups. Interestingly, though females were not regular game players, however they
were highly interested in playing a cybersecurity game, as majority of cyber-users
(males inclusive), believed that a cybersecurity knowledge gamification approach can
help enhance their cybersecurity knowledge and awareness. Conclusively, it is obvious
that both the young and old still lack basic cybersecurity knowledge, thereby making
them easy prey for cyberattacks. Gamification if applied properly into cybersecurity,
could be an interactive learning platform that is both enjoyable, produces a high spirit
of learning as well as help serve as a strong awareness tool that can boost cybersecurity
user’s knowledge.

okay jeg tnæker den her har noget noget rigtig ringe data, ***men*** jeg kunne forstille mig at den har noget fed litteratur, da den har undersøgt gamification i henhold til cybersikkerhed. 

## **Phish Derby**: Shoring the human shield through gamified Phishing attacks. 

>__abstract__: To better understand employees’ reporting behaviors in relation to phishing emails, we
gamiﬁed the phishing security awareness training process by creating and conducting a
month-long “Phish Derby” competition at a large university in the U.S. The university’s
Information Security Ofﬁce challenged employees to prove they could detect phishing
emails as part of the simulated phishing program currently in place. Employees volunteered
to compete for prizes during this special event and were instructed to report suspicious
emails as potential phishing attacks. Prior to the beginning of the competition, we collected
demographics and data related to the concepts central to two theoretical foundations: the
Big Five personality traits and goal orientation theory. We found several notable
relationships between demographic variables and Phish Derby performance, which
was operationalized from the number of phishing attacks reported and employee
report speed. Several key ﬁndings emerged, including past performance on simulated
phishing campaigns positively predicted Phish Derby performance; older participants
performed better than their younger colleagues, but more educated participants
performed poorer; and individuals who used a mix of PCs and Macs at work
performed worse than those using a single platform. We also found that two of the
Big Five personality dimensions, extraversion and agreeableness, were both associated
with poorer performance in phishing detection and reporting. Likewise, individuals who
were driven to perform well in the Phish Derby because they desired to learn from the
experience (i.e., learning goal orientation) performed at a lower level than those driven by
other goals. Interestingly, self-reported levels of computer skill and the perceived ability to
detect phishing messages failed to exhibit a signiﬁcant relationship with Phish Derby
performance. We discuss these ﬁndings and describe how focusing on motivating the
good in employee cyber behaviors is a necessary yet too often overlooked component in
organizations whose training cyber cultures are rooted in employee click rates alone

Den er lidt nice den her også. De holder observationer op imod antagelser om personligshedst typer og andre karaktaristika. Kan være brugbar! 

## A COMPARISON STUDY OF TWO CYBERSECURITY LEARNING SYSTEMS: FACEBOOK’S OPEN SOURCE CAPTURE THE FLAG AND CTFD

>__abstract__: There is a high demand for innovative and smart technologies to improve cybersecurity education and produce skilled
cybersecurity professionals in a faster, more engaging manner. Gamification, in the form of Capture the Flag (CTF)
platforms, are increasingly being used by educational institutions and in private and public industry sectors. A
previous 2018 study by Chicone and Burton investigated Facebook’s CTF platform as an open source inexpensive
learning and assessment tool for undergraduate and graduate IT/cybersecurity adult students for an online university.
In this comparative expansion study, the 2018 study was replicated but this time examining and comparing Facebook’s
CTF platform with another CTF platform called CTFd. The studies were evaluated on assessment capability. It was
found that Facebook’s CTF had very little to aid with assessment while CTFd provided many formative assessment
features that were valuable for students as well as for faculty in determining needs for future learning.

den har noget med CTF'er og det er sgu meget cool med mig. 

## Experiencing Cybersecurity One Game at a Time: A Systematic Review of Cybersecurity Digital Games

>__Abstract__: **Background**. Cybersecurity is of increasing importance in our interconnected
world, yet the field has a growing workforce deficit and an underrepresentation
of women and people of color. In an effort to address these issues, many digital
games have been created to teach individuals about cybersecurity and keeping
themselves, their data, and their networks safe.

>**Intervention**. We present the results of a systematic review of digital games
related to cybersecurity as a means to understand how players are being
introduced to cybersecurity in game-based contexts.\

>**Methods**. Using a systematic search, we identified 181 games related to cybersecurity
(either through content or aesthetics) by searching the Apple App Store, the
Google Play Store, Steam, and the web broadly. Each game was played for up
to an hour and characteristics such as the game story, game elements, and
presentation of cybersecurity were gathered.\

>**Results**. We found diverse conceptualizations of cybersecurity and of cybersecurity
professionals. Further, the nature of games and the framing of cybersecurity
varied by the platform and device on which the game was available (computer,
mobile, or web). Web games were most likely to present cybersecurity as cyber
safety and were more likely to be a gamified quiz or worksheet. Computer and mobile games tended to present cybersecurity through game aesthetics
or deep content engagement. The games mirrored the underrepresentation of
women and minoritized individuals in the field.\

>**Discussion**. With the variety of digital cybersecurity games and the differences in
games based on the platform on which the game is available, it is important
game developers move beyond presenting cybersecurity through gamification
and focusing on cyber safety. The current scope of cybersecurity games leaves
room for the development of games focused on deeper content engagement
with cybersecurity topics in an environment conducive to the broadening
participation goals of the cybersecurity field

okay hvis den her artiklen handler om en underrepæsentation af kvinder og POC er jeg delme out, men tror bare det er en hæslig introduktion de har skrevet. Der er vist noget lækkert kvant data i analyse af 181 spil.

## Usability and Workload Evaluation of a Cybersecurity educational gamle application: a case Study

>__abstract__ Currently, social networks and Internet access have become a place that fosters risky expe-
riences for their users, who are vulnerable and can become victims of violence, online abuse, extortion,
etc. Therefore, it is considered necessary to make people aware of the appropriate use of information and
communication technologies (ICTs) and Internet access, to minimize the risks and vulnerabilities associated
with these practices. This research analyzes the use of a game-like mobile application called CiberSecApp,
which was designed to support the teaching of basic cybersecurity. This application was designed as a game
because gamification has been shown to generate motivation and keep users interested in long periods of
time. In addition, the new generation of students perceives educational mobile apps as an innovative way
to access educational content in a simple, ubiquitous, and portable way Unlike other similar initiatives in
the existing literature, this research did not focus solely on the game design aspects, but also on evaluating
the user experience. For this purpose, the IBM Computer Usability Satisfaction Questionnaires (CSUQ) and
the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) were used to evaluate the usability of the mobile application and the
mental workload generated by the participants. A total of 60 engineering students participated voluntarily in
this research. The results obtained show that the use of gamification of educational content can support the
teaching of cybersecurity by creating an intention of use and with a low mental workload for its users.

Endnu engang en fed artikle! Den her undersøger kun et spil, men virker til at gå i dybden med sine respondenter.

## Getting Rid of the Usability/Security Trade-Off: A Behavioral Approach

>**abstract**:  The usability/security trade-off indicates the inversely proportional relationship that seems
to exist between usability and security. The more secure the systems, the less usable they will be. On
the contrary, more usable systems will be less secure. So far, attempts to reduce the gap between
usability and security have been unsuccessful. In this paper, we offer a theoretical perspective to
exploit this tradeoff rather than ﬁght it, as well as a practical approach to the use of contextual
improvements in system usability to reward secure behavior. The theoretical perspective, based on
the concept of reinforcement, has been successfully applied to several domains, and there is no reason
to believe that the cybersecurity domain will represent an exception. Although the purpose of this
article is to devise a research agenda, we also provide an example based on a single-case study where
we apply the rationale underlying our proposal in a laboratory experiment

okay fatter slet ikke hvad de mener med det her 

## Future forums: A methodology for exploring, gamifying, and raising security awareness of code-citizens

>__abstract__ Future Forums are multiphase user centered design workshops, with the early phases aiming to initiate dis-
cussions, that then leads to the co-design of game elements centered around aspects of code security. The same
procedure was followed for each of the three Future Forums, each focusing to a slightly different theme around
cyber security. By engaging code-citizens in discussions on cyber security that are rooted in their personal ex-
periences and individual viewpoints, several themes emerged, such as the role of coder practices and ethical
behavior in security while coding. Findings gave us a deep insight in the code-citizens’ ecosystem during code
development – both in terms of their individual beliefs and practices, and the practicalities they have to consider.
Discussions were followed by the co-design and co-creation of game elements. The game elements code-citizens
co-created allowed us to observe how code elements and code practices are represented with game elements,
informing future designs of security oriented serious games. This paper discusses the implications these findings
have to the design of cyber security oriented serious games, and to the wider HCI community working with
similar methodologies.

Okay forstår det som om at den tager en programmørs perspektiv? er ikke overtalt 

## Gamification of Cybersecurity Awareness for Non-IT Professionals: A Systematic Literature Review

>__abstract__ This literature review delves into research on the gamification of cybersecurity
awareness for non-IT professionals, aiming to provide an accurate report on
known and unknown information regarding three key questions: the impact of
gamification on cybersecurity awareness interest and engagement, measurable
results related to game elements and their connection to specific learning goals,
and the long-term effectiveness of gamified cybersecurity. Examining five
relevant papers, the findings confirm short-term effectiveness and indicate that
the incorporation of various game elements, such as storytelling, team
leaderboards, and interactive scenarios, results in increased knowledge,
improved engagement, and positive behavior changes aligned with specific
cybersecurity awareness learning goals. However, the review also identifies
recurring gaps in evaluating individual game elements and customizing
gamification strategies for non-IT professionals. Highlighting a critical gap in
understanding long-term effectiveness, we argue for further empirical studies
to consider habituation effects, emphasizing the need for a nuanced
understanding of gamification's impact on cybersecurity awareness over an
extended period. Thus, the review contributes to the existing body of
knowledge by emphasizing the necessity for empirical studies focusing on
sustained, long-term effectiveness and habituation effects in gamified
cybersecurity initiatives.

okay det er simpelthen et litteratur studie det her, men de undersøger kun fem artikler. Nok ikke tilstrækkeligt, VORES ER BEDRE.

## ENIGMA: An explainable digital twin security solution for cyber-physical systems
>__Abstract__: Digital Twins (DTs), being the virtual replicas of their physical counterparts, share valuable knowledge of
the underlying physical processes and act as data acquisition and dissemination sources to Cyber–Physical
System (CPS). Moreover, without obstructing the ongoing operations, DTs also provide an assessment platform
for evaluating the operational behavior and security of the CPS. Therefore, they become a potential source
of data breaches and a broad attack surface for attackers to launch covert attacks. To detect and mitigate
security loopholes in DTs, one of the potential solutions is to leverage a gamification approach that can assess
the security level of DTs while providing security analysts with a controlled and supportive virtual training
environment. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based approaches can complement the idea
of security orchestration and automation in the gamification approach. However, AI/ML-based DTs security
solutions are generally constrained by the lack of transparency of AI operations, which results in less confidence
in the decisions made by the AI models. To address the explainable security challenges of DTs, this article
proposes a gamification approach called sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA).
While leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming scenarios to assess DTs’
security and train security analysts. The game players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI
agents (the defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based DT security
assessment model that explains the decisions made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack
vectors for the defender team, i.e., the AI agent. The SHAP values illustrate the contribution of different
features towards predicting the outcome of attack vectors. This explanation can help security analysts to take
security measures based on reasoned and trustworthy decisions. Finally, experimental validation has been
carried out to demonstrate the viability of ENIGMA

har fucking ingen anelse om hvad de snakker om haha. Men det er nok guld , men nok teknisk

# PocketCTF: A Fully Featured Approach for Hosting Portable Attack and Defense Cybersecurity Exercises

>__abstract__: Capture the ﬂag (CTF) challenges are broadly used for engaging trainees in the technical
aspects of cybersecurity, maintaining hands-on lab exercises, and integrating gamiﬁcation elements.
However, deploying the appropriate digital environment for conducting cybersecurity exercises
can be challenging and typically requires a lot of effort and system resources by educators. In this
paper, we present PocketCTF, an extensible and fully independent CTF platform, open to educators
to run realistic virtual labs to host cybersecurity exercises in their classrooms. PocketCTF is based on
containerization technologies to minimize the deployment effort and to utilize less system resources.
A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the feasibility of deploying CTF challenges that
allows the trainees to engage not only in offensive security but also in defensive tasks that have to be
conducted during cybersecurity incidents. When using PocketCTF, educators can deploy hands-on
labs, spending less time on the deployment and without necessarily having the advanced technical
background to deploy complex labs and scenarios.

Okay altså der er jo nok noget i den, men virker mere til at være reklame for deres app. 

# Trends and challenges for balanced scoring in cybersecurity exercises: A case study on teh example of locked shields 

>__abstract__: Cybersecurity exercises (CSXs) enable raising organizational awareness, testing
capabilities, identifying strengths and weaknesses, and gaining hands-on
practice in building resilience against attacks. Typical CSX execution is designed
as a competition or a challenge with gamiﬁcation features to increase
participant engagement. Also, it requires a signiﬁcant amount of human
resources to ensure up-to-date attack simulation and proper feedback. The
usual concerns related to CSXs are how many points the team or participant
received and the reason behind the particular evaluation. Properly balanced
scoring can provide valuable feedback and keep CSX participants engaged. An
inadequate scoring system might have the opposite eﬀect—spread disorder,
cause discontent, decrease motivation, and distract the participants from the
event’s primary goal. Combining both technical and soft sides in CSX makes it
increasingly complex and challenging to ensure a balanced scoring. This paper
deﬁnes scoring challenges and trends based on the case study of one of the
largest international live-ﬁre cyber defense exercises, Locked Shields (LS). It
reviews the CSX scoring categories of the recent LS executions and provides
the most common participant concerns related to scoring. The feedback
shows that clarity and transparency of the scoring system together with
providing feedback and justiﬁcation to the scores are one of the top concerns.
The design choices of the scoring system are explored to demonstrate
the subtle variations of balanced category scoring and make a basis for
future discussions. The chosen contrast and comparison approach enabled
distinguishing four parameters for design decision categories: complexity,
transparency, level of competition, and automatization. The research results
demonstrate that learning facilitation requires system simpliﬁcation and
decisions regarding trends of the scoring curve. Even though transparency is a
critical issue, concealing some scoring logic details can ensure more ﬂexibility
during the event to stimulate participants, support learning experiences, and
cope with unexpected situations. Time as a central dimension enables the
implementation of complex scoring curves for automated assessment. Our study contributes to the community of higher education institutions and all
organizers of cybersecurity challenges for skill development and assessment.

bare det at de kalder det CSX er et minu point da jeg er 60 procent sikker at det er CTF'er de snakker om men der er da håb.

# Development of a Platform for Learning Cybersecurity Using Capturing the Flag Competitions

>__abstract__: Currently, cybersecurity is a topic of great importance for society. With the increase in
the use of technology and the digitization of many activities, the number of cyber threats to which
individuals and organizations are exposed has increased. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic
has accelerated the digitization of many processes, further increasing the risk of cyberattacks. One
of the main causes of these problems is the lack of cyber security awareness, as many people and
organizations do not have a proper understanding of cyber threats and the measures, they must take
to protect themselves. As a solution to the lack of cybersecurity knowledge, this work proposes the
development of a Capture the Flag platform for learning about cybersecurity. The objective is to
provide a tool that allows the education of future professionals in this ﬁeld and covers the existing
demand for this type of specialist. The platform is made up of two sections, one for learning and
the other for CTF. The ﬁrst section allows teachers to contribute to the teaching of their students
using challenges. The second section allows one to carry out competitions with effective results when
acquiring knowledge and experience. The platform is evaluated using questionnaires and surveys to
measure whether the platform fulﬁlls its purpose.

okay kan være der er nogle spændende ufnd, men præmissen er demle dum - de vil lave HackTheBoc/TryHackMe

# Hands-on CYbersecurity Training behavior data for process mining. 

>__abstract__ : The research on using process mining in learning analytics
of cybersecurity exercises relies on datasets that reﬂect the
real behavior of trainees. Although modern cyber ranges, in
which training sessions are organized, can collect behavioral
data in the form of event logs, the organization of such ex-
ercises is laborious. Moreover, the collected raw data has to
be processed and transformed into a speciﬁc format required
by process mining techniques. We present two datasets with
slightly different characteristics. While the ﬁrst exercise with
52 participants was not limited in time, the second super-
vised exercise with 42 trainees lasted two hours. Also, the
cybersecurity tasks were slightly different. A total of 11757
events were collected. Of these, 3597 were training progress
events, 5669 were Bash commands, and 2491 were Metas-
ploit commands. Joint CSV ﬁles distilled from the raw event
data can be used as input for existing process mining tools.

okay det her er nok for teknisk for os. er Riiiimelig sikker på at det er machine learning ? 

# Educational and Cybersecurity Applications of an Arabic CAPTCHA Gamification System

>__abstract__: A ubiquitous challenge-response mechanism, the Completely Automated Public Turing test
to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA), primarily serves to distinguish between
human users and automated bots. The presented work introduces an innovative Arabic
CAPTCHA gamification system designed to concurrently address two critical aspects. The
first aspect is centered on the pedagogical application of the system, particularly its
employment in teaching young learners the Arabic alphabet. This is achieved by posing
interactive queries based on displayed word images, thereby facilitating the practice and
enhancement of Arabic letter recognition and typing proficiencies. The second aspect
integrates a cybersecurity awareness component into the system. As learners engage with
the game and advance through its levels, they are concurrently exposed to pertinent
information and guidance regarding cyber threats and safe online practices. This dual-
purpose approach serves to inform and empower learners, providing them with the
necessary skills to navigate the digital landscape securely. The novelty of this work lies in
the fusion of these two aspects, offering a uniquely comprehensive learning experience that
not only bolsters language skills but also cultivates cybersecurity awareness, a critical facet
of digital literacy in our increasingly interconnected world. To the authors' knowledge, this
work represents the inaugural implementation of an Arabic CAPTCHA gamification
system, making it an advantageous resource for anyone seeking to learn Arabic letters and
word formations.

sgu ikke helt sikker på jeg fatter det her men lets go 

# Analyzing Students’ Self-Perception of Success and Learning Effectiveness Using Gamification in an Online Cybersecurity Course

>__Abstract__: This paper analyzes students’ self-perception of success and learning effectiveness after using
non-compulsory gamiﬁcation in an online Cybcourse. For this purpose, we designed a cybersecurity game
based on cognitive constructivism learning theory. We built the game scenes using metaphors to present the
main Cybersecurity contents to the students. We delivered the game in a regular course with two objectives:
ﬁrst, to ﬁnd the primary design factors that affect students’ self-perception of success. We propose a structural
equation model to ﬁnd out the elements with the most signiﬁcant impact on the students’ self-perception of
success. The results show that the realistic game design and the contextualization of the game do have a
notable inﬂuence. They are both examples of best practices in game design; second, to evaluate the learning
effectiveness of the game. The results suggest a high correlation between playing the game and succeeding
in the course. Moreover, chronological analysis of the performance reveals that the intention to play the
game could be a simple dropout predictor. Thus, introducing the game in the educational curricula improves
student engagement and consolidates their knowledge on cybersecurity

Lyder delme dumt. *"Self-perception"* "Vi spurgte nogle elver om de selv syntes de var gode" 

# Successful gamification of cybersecurity training

>__Abstract__: The behavioral aspect of cybersecurity has gained more attention in recent years. By their actions, people can
improve the security of their devices and organizations, but also hinder the successful implementation of
security in these areas. As awareness campaigns where information is merely distributed are not effective, we
designed a cybersecurity serious game applicable for cybersecurity training. The effectiveness of this game was
experimentally tested against a noncybersecurity game that did or did not contain cybersecurity information,
through measures of the theory of planned behavior. Results showed that the cybersecurity game resulted in
higher self-reported scores on attitudes, perceived behavioral control, intentions, and behavior compared with
both noncybersecurity games. For subjective norms, we only found an effect in the comparison between the
cybersecurity game and the noncybersecurity game without additional information.

___WTF!___ hvad sker der med to i streg med "self-reported" ellers fed titel der matcher vores. 

# Towards an Innovative Model for Cybersecurity Awareness Training

>__Abstract__: The rapid evolution of cybersecurity threats poses a significant challenge to organiza-
tions and individuals, necessitating strengthening defense mechanisms against malicious operations.
Amidst this ever-changing environment, the importance of implementing efficacious cybersecurity
awareness training has escalated dramatically. This paper presents the Integrated Cybersecurity
Awareness Training (iCAT) model, which leverages knowledge graphs, serious games, and gamifica-
tion to enhance cybersecurity training. The iCAT model’s micro-learning module increases flexibility
and accessibility, while real-time progress monitoring and adaptive feedback ensure effective learning
outcomes. Evaluations show improved participant engagement and knowledge retention, making
iCAT a practical and efficient solution for cybersecurity challenges. With an emphasis on adaptability
and applicability, iCAT provides organizations in search of accessible and efficient cybersecurity
awareness training with a streamlined approach.

# A Cloud Game-Based Educative Platform Architecture: The CyberScratch Project 

>__Abstract__: The employment of modern technologies is widespread in our society, so the inclusion of
practical activities for education has become essential and useful at the same time. These activities are
more noticeable in Engineering, in areas such as cybersecurity, data science, artiﬁcial intelligence, etc.
Additionally, these activities acquire even more relevance with a distance education methodology, as
our case is. The inclusion of these practical activities has clear advantages , such as (1) promoting
critical thinking and (2) improving students’ abilities and skills for their professional careers. There
are several options, such as the use of remote and virtual laboratories, virtual reality and game-
based platforms, among others. This work addresses the development of a new cloud game-based
educational platform, which deﬁnes a modular and ﬂexible architecture (using light containers).
This architecture provides interactive and monitoring services and data storage in a transparent
way. The platform uses gamiﬁcation to integrate the game as part of the instructional process. The
CyberScratch project is a particular implementation of this architecture focused on cybersecurity
game-based activities. The data privacy management is a critical issue for these kinds of platforms,
so the architecture is designed with this feature integrated in the platform components. To achieve
this goal, we ﬁrst focus on all the privacy aspects for the data generated by our cloud game-based
platform, by considering the European legal context for data privacy following GDPR and ISO/IEC
TR 20748-1:2016 recommendations for Learning Analytics (LA). Our second objective is to provide
implementation guidelines for efﬁcient data privacy management for our cloud game-based educative
platform. All these contributions are not found in current related works. The CyberScratch project,
which was approved by UNED for the year 2020, considers using the xAPI standard for data handling
and services for the game editor, game engine and game monitor modules of CyberScratch. Therefore,
apart from considering GDPR privacy and LA recommendations, our cloud game-based architecture
covers all phases from game creation to the ﬁnal users’ interactions with the game.

Lyder delme som en stinking pile of dogshit. "Cloud game-based educative platform architecture" bro fuuuuuuck af. Det skal være så godt for at leve op til navnet haha.

# Gamification-Based Cybersecurity Awareness Course for Self-regulated Learning
>__Abstract__: Present era of massive use of the internet has
brought us enormous access to information and knowledge, yet
has exposed us to such cybersecurity threats as personal
information fraudulency and theft. Therefore, to safely and
beneficially use cyberspace’s information services, it is
necessary and inevitable to raise awareness of cybersecurity.
Aiming at building an environment to support cyberspace users
