## Appling tracking game system to measure user behavior toward cybersecurity policies

>Institutions wrestle to protect their information from threats and cybercrime.
Therefore, it is dedicating a great deal of their concern to improving the
information security infrastructure. Users’ behaviors were explored by
applying traditional questionnaire as a research instrument in data collocate
process. But researchers usually suffer from a lack of respondents' credibility
when asking someone to fill out a questionnaire, and the credibility may
decline further if the research topic relates to aspects of the use and
implementation of information security policies. Therefore, there is
insufficient reliability of the respondent's answers to the questionnaire’s
questions, and the responses might not reflect the actual behavior based on
the human bias when facing the problems theoretically. The current study
creates a new idea to track and study the behavior of the respondents by
building a tracking game system aligned with the questionnaire whose
results are required to be known. The system will allow the respondent to
answer the survey questions related to the compliance with the information
security policies by tracking their behavior while using the system



Den virker rimelig brugbar. der er noget snak om bias og indsamling af respondenter. 

## Design and Evaluation of an Augmented Reality Game for Cybersecurity Awareness (CybAR)

>**abstract**: Abstract: The number of damaging cyberattacks is increasing exponentially due in part to lack of
user awareness of risky online practices, such as visiting unsafe websites, ignoring warning messages,
and communicating with unauthenticated entities. Although research has established the role that
game-based learning can play in cognitive development and conceptual learning, relatively few
serious mobile games have been developed to educate users about different forms of cyberattack and
ways of avoiding them. This paper reports the development of an effective augmented reality (AR)
game designed to increase cybersecurity awareness and knowledge in an active and entertaining
way. The Cybersecurity Awareness using Augmented Reality (CybAR) game is an AR mobile
application that teaches not only cybersecurity concepts, but also demonstrates the consequences
of actual cybersecurity attacks through feedback. The design and evaluation of the application are
described in detail. A survey was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the game received positive
responses from 91 participants. The results indicate that CybAR is useful for players to develop an
understanding of cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities.

Det er et mobile game - så et faktisk spil, men det direkte takler awareness og har kvant data med 91 respondenter. jeg kan godt lide det. 

## Gamification of Cybersecurity for Workforce Development in Critical Infrastructure

>**abstract**: Critical infrastructure has become a focal point of cyberattacks, as previously isolated
operational technology networks that were once perceived to be air-gapped are becoming Internet-exposed
through increased connectivity with informational technology networks. Recent adversarial tendencies have
led to an increase in targeted cyberattacks against both industrial control systems (ICS) and building
automation systems. Furthermore, the insufﬁcient supply of a cyber workforce exacerbates the challenges
for organizations to defend their systems. Game-based learning is gaining traction and studies have shown
that it is an effective educational element. Training facility operators responsible for critical services can
be achieved through gamiﬁcation of security policies and controls. The Network Defense Training Game
(NDTG) is a cybersecurity training platform that encompasses a series of cybersecurity events that the player
must assess and react to throughout the scenario to defend the network by thwarting the adversary’s attack.
The NDTG uses scenario narratives based on historical cyber incidents that affect ICS. It is designed to train
facility owners and operators to evaluate their cybersecurity posture and to apply cybersecurity frameworks
before and during the process of addressing cyber events and incidents. This study provides a detailed
technical overview and design architecture of NDTG and demonstrates its capability in advancing the ICS
cybersecurity workforce

okay altså casen er virkelig fed... men det er *"detailed technical overview"*. Men tror stadig godt vi kan få noget ud af det. 

## Digital tools and challenges in human resourcedevelopment and its potential within the maritime sector through bibliometric analysis

>**abstract**: The maritime industry, a cornerstone of global trade and commerce, is currently undergoing a
significant transformation, primarily driven by technological advancements. Human resource
development (HRD) in maritime industry has become a focal point, aimed at improving opera-
tional efficiency, safety, and competitiveness. This research paper conducts an in-depth exam-
ination of digital tools and its challenges in the context of maritime HRD through bibliometric
analysis. The findings indicate the presence of a variety of digital technologies, such as e-learning
platforms (ELP), learning management systems (LMS), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),
gamification, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Nevertheless, the maritime
sector may encounter a range of obstacles including issues related to security concerns, skill
gaps, strategic planning, change management, budget constraints, and regulatory compliance.
To effectively address these difficulties, it is essential to adopt a comprehensive strategy that
includes many components such as cybersecurity measures, efforts for talent development,
strategic alignment, change management techniques, budgetary restraint, and legal scrutiny.
The findings of this study have significant consequences for the maritime sector, governments,
and the academic community. It is recommended that maritime sector can use digitization as a
fundamental component of their competitiveness and safety measures.

Først tænke jeg den var helt ubrugelig den her, men viser sig den undersøger vores problem stilling i henhold til den maritime sector. Kan måske være fedt til at understrege visse pointer?

## Cybercompetitions: A survey of competitions, tools, and systems to support cybersecurity education

>**abstract**: Over the last decade, industry and academia have worked towards raising stu-
dents’ interests in cybersecurity through game-like competitions to fill a shortfall
of cybersecurity professionals. Rising interest in video games in combination with
gamification techniques make learning fun, easy, and addictive. It is crucial that
cybersecurity curricula enhance and expose cybersecurity education to a diversified
student body to meet workforce demands. Gamification through cybercompetitions
is one method to achieve that. With a vast list of options for competition type,
focus areas, learning outcomes, and participant experience levels we need to system-
atize knowledge of attributes that ameliorate cybercompetitions. In the wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic and global lock-downs, competition hosts scrambled to move
platforms from local to online infrastructure due to poor interoperability between
competition software. We derive a list of takeaways including the lack of interop-
erability between state-of-the-art competition systems, breaking the high knowledge
barrier to participate, addressing competition type diversity, then suggest potential
solutions and research questions moving forward. Our paper aims to systematize
cybersecurity, access control, and programming competitions by surveying the his-
tory of these events. We explore the types of competitions that have been hosted
and categorize them based on focus areas related to the InfoSEC Color Wheel. We
then explore state-of-the-art technologies that enable these types of competitions, and
finally, present our takeaways.

**well this is just fuckign delisous.** Virker til at være en oversigt over alle værktøjer der bruges til at understøtte cybersecurity træning. 

## Cybersecurity Knowledge Deterioration and the role of Gamification Intervention
>**abtract**: Cybersecurity is becoming an overly critical issue in contemporary times. Cyberspace
safety is declining, covering all sphere of humanity. Deterioration in cybersecurity
knowledge and awareness has resulted to more cybercrime victimisation. The more
novel security systems are being developed, the higher the innovativeness of
cybercriminals techniques to attack cyber-users. Thus, investigating the stance of
cybersecurity knowledge among general IT (Information Technology) users, especially
in the 21st century is paramount. This paper designed a cybersecurity quiz based on
adaptations from literature and past cybersecurity quizzes and conducted
investigations to test the knowledge of random cyber-users. Results from investigations
are instructive, thus serving as a propelling motivation to develop a cybersecurity game.
Findings reveal that most cyber-users lack knowledge about network security. Also,
respondents lacked knowledge on social engineering. Thus, it is important for upcoming
innovations to consider aspects of network security, social engineering when designing
cybersecurity gamification approaches. Gamification has been used as teaching aids for
diverse learning fields, however its application in cybersecurity is still understudied. The
result of this quiz is intended to further boost the development of a cybersecurity game,
which can be age centric, thus developing suitable cybersecurity games for specific user
groups. Interestingly, though females were not regular game players, however they
were highly interested in playing a cybersecurity game, as majority of cyber-users
(males inclusive), believed that a cybersecurity knowledge gamification approach can
help enhance their cybersecurity knowledge and awareness. Conclusively, it is obvious
that both the young and old still lack basic cybersecurity knowledge, thereby making
them easy prey for cyberattacks. Gamification if applied properly into cybersecurity,
could be an interactive learning platform that is both enjoyable, produces a high spirit
of learning as well as help serve as a strong awareness tool that can boost cybersecurity
user’s knowledge.

okay jeg tnæker den her har noget noget rigtig ringe data, ***men*** jeg kunne forstille mig at den har noget fed litteratur, da den har undersøgt gamification i henhold til cybersikkerhed. 

## **Phish Derby**: Shoring the human shield through gamified Phishing attacks. 

>__abstract__: To better understand employees’ reporting behaviors in relation to phishing emails, we
gamiﬁed the phishing security awareness training process by creating and conducting a
month-long “Phish Derby” competition at a large university in the U.S. The university’s
Information Security Ofﬁce challenged employees to prove they could detect phishing
emails as part of the simulated phishing program currently in place. Employees volunteered
to compete for prizes during this special event and were instructed to report suspicious
emails as potential phishing attacks. Prior to the beginning of the competition, we collected
demographics and data related to the concepts central to two theoretical foundations: the
Big Five personality traits and goal orientation theory. We found several notable
relationships between demographic variables and Phish Derby performance, which
was operationalized from the number of phishing attacks reported and employee
report speed. Several key ﬁndings emerged, including past performance on simulated
phishing campaigns positively predicted Phish Derby performance; older participants
performed better than their younger colleagues, but more educated participants
performed poorer; and individuals who used a mix of PCs and Macs at work
performed worse than those using a single platform. We also found that two of the
Big Five personality dimensions, extraversion and agreeableness, were both associated
with poorer performance in phishing detection and reporting. Likewise, individuals who
were driven to perform well in the Phish Derby because they desired to learn from the
experience (i.e., learning goal orientation) performed at a lower level than those driven by
other goals. Interestingly, self-reported levels of computer skill and the perceived ability to
detect phishing messages failed to exhibit a signiﬁcant relationship with Phish Derby
performance. We discuss these ﬁndings and describe how focusing on motivating the
good in employee cyber behaviors is a necessary yet too often overlooked component in
organizations whose training cyber cultures are rooted in employee click rates alone

Den er lidt nice den her også. De holder observationer op imod antagelser om personligshedst typer og andre karaktaristika. Kan være brugbar! 

## A COMPARISON STUDY OF TWO CYBERSECURITY LEARNING SYSTEMS: FACEBOOK’S OPEN SOURCE CAPTURE THE FLAG AND CTFD

>__abstract__: There is a high demand for innovative and smart technologies to improve cybersecurity education and produce skilled
cybersecurity professionals in a faster, more engaging manner. Gamification, in the form of Capture the Flag (CTF)
platforms, are increasingly being used by educational institutions and in private and public industry sectors. A
previous 2018 study by Chicone and Burton investigated Facebook’s CTF platform as an open source inexpensive
learning and assessment tool for undergraduate and graduate IT/cybersecurity adult students for an online university.
In this comparative expansion study, the 2018 study was replicated but this time examining and comparing Facebook’s
CTF platform with another CTF platform called CTFd. The studies were evaluated on assessment capability. It was
found that Facebook’s CTF had very little to aid with assessment while CTFd provided many formative assessment
features that were valuable for students as well as for faculty in determining needs for future learning.

den har noget med CTF'er og det er sgu meget cool med mig. 

## Experiencing Cybersecurity One Game at a Time: A Systematic Review of Cybersecurity Digital Games

>__Abstract__: **Background**. Cybersecurity is of increasing importance in our interconnected
world, yet the field has a growing workforce deficit and an underrepresentation
of women and people of color. In an effort to address these issues, many digital
games have been created to teach individuals about cybersecurity and keeping
themselves, their data, and their networks safe.

>**Intervention**. We present the results of a systematic review of digital games
related to cybersecurity as a means to understand how players are being
introduced to cybersecurity in game-based contexts.\

>**Methods**. Using a systematic search, we identified 181 games related to cybersecurity
(either through content or aesthetics) by searching the Apple App Store, the
Google Play Store, Steam, and the web broadly. Each game was played for up
to an hour and characteristics such as the game story, game elements, and
presentation of cybersecurity were gathered.\

>**Results**. We found diverse conceptualizations of cybersecurity and of cybersecurity
professionals. Further, the nature of games and the framing of cybersecurity
varied by the platform and device on which the game was available (computer,
mobile, or web). Web games were most likely to present cybersecurity as cyber
safety and were more likely to be a gamified quiz or worksheet. Computer and mobile games tended to present cybersecurity through game aesthetics
or deep content engagement. The games mirrored the underrepresentation of
women and minoritized individuals in the field.\

>**Discussion**. With the variety of digital cybersecurity games and the differences in
games based on the platform on which the game is available, it is important
game developers move beyond presenting cybersecurity through gamification
and focusing on cyber safety. The current scope of cybersecurity games leaves
room for the development of games focused on deeper content engagement
with cybersecurity topics in an environment conducive to the broadening
participation goals of the cybersecurity field
